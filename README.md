Computing 1 - Class Rules & Structure
Welcome to Computing 1! This class is about thinking like a programmer, solving problems, and using computers in ways that will benefit your future.
Our goal is not just to learn syntax but to understand logic, problem-solving, and how to work with AI-powered tools.

📜 Class Rules
To keep the class productive and enjoyable, we will follow these four simple rules:
🚫 No Gaming or Unnecessary Browsing


Keep your focus on the class.
If you’re caught gaming or distracted, you lose computer access for the session.


🤝 Respect Everyone


No mocking, interruptions, or unnecessary noise.
If someone asks a question, help them instead of laughing or ignoring.


🙋 Engage & Participate


This is an interactive class, not a boring lecture.
The more you participate, the easier and more fun learning will be.


🤖 AI is Allowed, but NOT a Crutch


AI can help you but will not replace learning the fundamentals.
We will use AI to generate, debug, and optimize code, but you must understand what’s happening.
If we respect these rules, this will be an engaging and smooth learning experience! 🚀

🗓️ Course Plan (Lessons Overview)
Here’s what we will cover in 15 classes:
Introduction to Computing & C# – Understanding programming and setting up your tools.
Variables & Data Types – How to store and work with different types of data.
Operators & Expressions – Performing calculations and logic in code.
Control Structures (If-Else, Switch) – Making decisions in programming.
Loops (For, While, Do-While) – Repeating tasks efficiently.
Functions & AI-Assisted Code Generation – Writing reusable code.
Arrays & Lists – Working with collections of data.
Strings & String Manipulation – Handling text in C#.
File Handling – Reading and writing data to files.
Basic OOP (Classes & Objects) – Introduction to object-oriented programming.
Debugging & AI-Powered Debugging – Finding and fixing errors in code.
Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Sorting, searching, and solving logic problems.
Mini Project – Creating a small program integrating everything you’ve learned.
Optimization & Real-World Examples – How to write better, efficient code.
Final Revision & Q&A – Preparing for future learning.

📌 Class Structure (How Each Lesson Will Be Organized)
To keep things structured and predictable, every class will follow this format:
1️⃣ Short Introduction (5-10 min) – I introduce today’s topic briefly.
 2️⃣ AI Exploration (10-15 min) – We’ll see how AI can help us with the topic.
 3️⃣ Guided Coding Session (20-25 min) – We will code together, step by step.
 4️⃣ Student Coding Task (15-20 min) – You solve a problem while I assist you.
 5️⃣ Debugging & Discussion (10 min) – We’ll fix common mistakes and discuss improvements.
 6️⃣ Wrap-Up & Next Steps (5 min) – A summary and preview of what’s coming next.
🚀 This ensures minimal boring theory and maximum hands-on coding.

✅ Final Words
If you follow these rules and structure, this course will be engaging, useful, and fun. Let’s work together, learn, and build something amazing!
