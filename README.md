# 💻 **Computing 1 — Class Rules & Structure**

### 👋 Welcome to *Computing 1!*

This class is about **thinking like a programmer**, solving problems, and using computers in ways that will benefit your future.  
We’re not just learning syntax — we’re building **logic, problem-solving skills**, and learning how to work with **AI-powered tools**.  

---

## 📜 **Class Rules**

To keep the class **productive and enjoyable**, we’ll follow 4 simple rules:

### 🚫 No Gaming or Unnecessary Browsing
Stay focused on classwork.  
➡️ If you're caught gaming or being distracted, you'll lose computer access **for the session**.

### 🤝 Respect Everyone  
No mocking, no interruptions, and **no unnecessary noise**.  
➡️ If someone asks a question, help them — don’t laugh or ignore.

### 🙋 Engage & Participate  
This is not a boring lecture — it’s **interactive**!  
➡️ The more you participate, the more fun and easier it will be.

### 🤖 AI is Allowed, but NOT a Crutch  
AI will assist us — but **cannot replace understanding**.  
➡️ We’ll use it to generate, debug, and optimize code — but you must **understand what’s happening**.

> If we all respect these rules, we’ll create a smooth, fun, and engaging learning environment! 🚀
