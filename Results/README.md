# C# Programming Review Activities - Class Results

## Overall Program

Over the past four weeks, we've engaged in exciting review activities to reinforce our C# programming skills:

1. **Programming Escape Room Challenge** - Teams solved coding puzzles to "escape" virtual rooms
2. **Build Your Own Text Adventure Game** - Students created interactive text-based games
3. **Competitive Coding Tournament** - Teams competed to solve timed programming challenges
4. **Real-world Problem Solving Workshop** - Students developed applications for practical scenarios

Below are the results from each activity. Congratulations to all participants for your hard work and creativity!

## Week 8: Programming Escape Room Challenge

Teams worked together to solve five programming puzzles, each focusing on different C# concepts. The puzzles tested knowledge of variables, control structures, loops, functions, and arrays.

| 1 | Genti, Enis, Edonik | 4.0/5 |
| 2 | Devlete, Erza | 3.75/5 |
| 3 | Edonisa, Fatbardha, Nebahate | 3.6/5 |
| 3 | Leutrim Hajra, Erion Miftari | 3.6/5 |
| 5 | Valdrin, Albion, Valdet | 3.5/5 |
| 6 | Learti, Albatriti, Alberti | 3.1/5 |
| 6 | Artiola, Erda | 3.1/5 |
| 6 | Amra, Thesari, Xhaferi | 3.1/5 |
| 6 | Anil, Argjend | 3.1/5 |
| 10 | Argjenda, Albina, Albiona | 1.8/5 |
| 11 | Artin, Habib | 1.0/5 |
| 11 | Flutura, Hata | 1.0/5 |

### Challenge Insights

- **Most Challenging Puzzle**: Function Forge (Puzzle 4) - Creating and fixing functions
- **Easiest Puzzle**: Entry Room (Puzzle 1) - Working with variables and data types
- **Key Skills Demonstrated**: Debugging, logical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving

Congratulations to **Genti, Enis, and Edonik** for achieving the highest score and being the first team to escape!

## Week 9: Text Adventure Game Development

Students created interactive text-based adventure games using object-oriented programming principles. Games were evaluated on functionality, creativity, code structure, and player experience.

### Project Showcase

*Coming soon - Games will be evaluated and results posted here after project submissions*

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Code organization and structure (30%)
- Game mechanics implementation (30%)
- Creativity and storytelling (20%)
- User experience and error handling (20%)

## Week 10: Competitive Coding Tournament

Teams competed through multiple rounds of coding challenges with increasing difficulty. Points were awarded for correctness, efficiency, and elegance of solutions.

### Tournament Results

*Coming soon - Tournament will be held next week and results posted here*

#### Tournament Format:
- Round 1: Fundamentals (3 problems)
- Round 2: Intermediate (3 problems)
- Round 3: Advanced (2 problems)
- Final Challenge: Comprehensive problem worth 50 points

## Week 11: Real-world Problem Solving Workshop

Students applied their programming skills to develop applications addressing real-world scenarios. Projects included inventory systems, finance trackers, grade managers, and event schedulers.

### Project Results

*Coming soon - Workshop will be held in two weeks and results posted here*

#### Project Options:
- Personal Finance Tracker
- Inventory Management System
- Student Grade Manager
- Event Scheduler
